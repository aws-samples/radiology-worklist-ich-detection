# Explainable Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection for Radiologist Workflow Prioritization

Intracranial hemorrhage, a severe medical condition occurring within the cranium, necessitates rapid and intensive medical intervention. This condition contributes significantly to stroke cases, which rank as the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. Timely and accurate identification of the hemorrhage's location and type is paramount for effective patient treatment. To address this urgent medical need, we explore the impact of integrating AI and machine learning in radiology workflows. By leveraging computer vision model and advanced explainable AI to reprioritize worklists, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnosing intracranial hemorrhage. This process promises to streamline patient care, reduce the time to diagnosis, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in clinical settings.

## Data Collection and Loading
The ICH data was collected from the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection challenge which was designed to identify acute intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious condition caused by various factors, including trauma and high blood pressure, leading to symptoms that can range from headaches to life-threatening complications. Radiologists are key in detecting and assessing the hemorrhage to guide potential emergency surgical decisions. For this work, we collected the data for hemmorhage types and non-hemorrhage examples.
